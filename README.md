# PHP to update html using CSV file

Use PHP to open a CSV file that is located on the server, and creating a Table with the CSV data as its contents!

This will only work if you place all the files in a server, cause this is server side language. Github Pages won't run it either.

```html

```
<!-- just ending html in case I want to add more text later -->
